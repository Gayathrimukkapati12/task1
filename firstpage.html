<p>Butterflies are the adult flying stage of certain insects belonging to an order or group called <u>Lepidoptera</u>.
 Moths also belong to this group. The word "Lepidoptera" means "scaly wings" in Greek. This name perfectly suits the
 insects in this group because their wings are covered with thousands of tiny scales overlapping in rows.The scales,
 which are arranged in <i> colorful designs unique to each species</i>, are what gives the butterfly its beauty.like
 all other insects, butterflies have six legs and three main body parts: head, thorax (chest or mid section) 
 and abdomen (tail end). They also have two antennae and an exoskeleton.</p>

<p>A life cycle is made up of the stages that a living organism goes through during its lifetime from beginning to end.
 A butterfly undergoes a process called <b>complete metamorphosis</b> during its life cycle. This means that the butterfly 
changes completely from its early larval stage, when it is a caterpillar, until the final stage, when it becomes a 
beautiful and graceful adult butterfly. The butterfly life cycle has four stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. 
<strong>Butterflies are complex creatures</strong> Their day-to-day lives can be <big> characterized by many activities</big>.
If you are observant you may see butterflies involved in many of the follow activities.  To observe some activities, such as 
hybernation, may involve some detective work.  To observe other activities such as basking, puddling, or migrating, 
you will need to be at the proper place at the proper time.  Keep an activity log and see how many different butterflies 
you can spot involved in each activity.  The information from the individual butterfly pages may give you some hints as to 
where (or on what plants) some of these activities are likely to occur.</p>
